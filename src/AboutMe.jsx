                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>Hello! I am Anthony Micco. I was inspired to pursue a career in the
                        computer science field after taking a computer science course during
                        my sophomore year of high school. Since that time, I have devloped a passion
                        for coding and devloping software and look forward to continuing to learn
                        and grow as a devloper.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am currently going into my third year of school at Youngstown State University.
                        I am working towards earning Bachelor of Science degrees in computer science
                        and mathematics, with an expected graduation of May 2025. Aspiring to forge a career
                        in the broad field of computer science, I am eager to leverage my proficiency in
                        programming languages and algorithm design to contribute to modern technological
                        advancements. With a commitment to continuous learning and problem-solving prowess,
                        I seek to excel as a versatile software engineer and make a meaningful impact in the industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I currently work as a computer technology intern for the Boardman Local School District in
                        Boardman, Ohio.
                    </p>
