                <p className="about_para">Hello! I am Anthony Micco. I was inspired to pursue a career in the
                    computer science field after taking a computer science course during
                    my sophomore year of high school. Since that time, I have devloped a passion
                    for coding and devloping software and look forward to continuing to learn
                    and grow as a devloper.<br></br><br></br>
                    I am currently going into my third year of school at Youngstown State University.
                    I am working towards earning Bachelor of Science degree in computer science
                    with an expected graduation of May 2025. I'm aspiring to forge a career
                    in the broad field of computer science, I am eager to leverage my proficiency in
                    programming languages and algorithm design to contribute to modern technological
                    advancements. With a commitment to continuous learning and problem-solving prowess,
                    I seek to excel as a versatile software engineer and make a meaningful impact in the industry.<br></br><br></br>
                    I currently work as a middle school football coach in the Boardman Local School District in
